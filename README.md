Each item's class shows how the item works.
ActionBar class is used to send action bars to player, is currently only used on Jetpack.
Cooldown class is used to put cooldowns on items, is currently only used on wand (because cooldown is annoying).
CheckItem class is used to check item's display name, meta and all that. Is used on every item so just made a class for it.
